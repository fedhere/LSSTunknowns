    abstract = "{We report the discovery of an unusual object near the spiral galaxy IC 2497, discovered by visual inspection of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as part of the Galaxy Zoo project. The object, known as Hanny's Voorwerp, is bright in the SDSS g band due to unusually strong [O iii]4959, 5007 emission lines. We present the results of the first targeted observations of the object in the optical, ultraviolet and X-ray, which show that the object contains highly ionized gas. Although the line ratios are similar to extended emission-line regions near luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), the source of this ionization is not apparent. The emission-line properties, and lack of X-ray emission from IC 2497, suggest either a highly obscured AGN with a novel geometry arranged to allow photoionization of the object but not the galaxy's own circumnuclear gas, or, as we argue, the first detection of a quasar light echo. In this case, either the luminosity of the central source has decreased dramatically or else the obscuration in the system has increased within 105 yr. This object may thus represent the first direct probe of quasar history on these time-scales.}",

abstract="This paper presents an anomaly detection approach based on clustering and classification for intrusion detection (ID). We use connections obtained from raw packet data of the audit trail as basic elements, then map the network connection records into 8 feature spaces typically of high dimension according to their protocols and services. The approach includes two steps, training stage and testing stage. We perform clustering to group training data points into clusters, from which we select some clusters as normal and known-attack profile according to certain criterion. For those training data excluded from the profile, we use them to build a specific classifier. During the testing stage, we utilize influence-based classification algorithm to classify network behaviors. In the algorithm, an influence function quantifies the influence of an object. The experiments on the KDD'99 Intrusion Detection Data Set demonstrate the detection performance and the effectiveness of our ID approach.",

	journal = {Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific},
	abstract = {We identify minimal observing cadence requirements that enable photometric astronomical surveys to detect and recognize fast and explosive transients and fast transient features. Observations in two different filters within a short time window (e.g., g-and-i, or r-and-z, within 1.5 hr) are desirable for this purpose. Such an observing strategy delivers both the color and light curve evolution of transients on the same night. This allows the identification and initial characterization of fast transientâor fast features of longer timescale transientsâsuch as rapidly declining supernovae, kilonovae, and the signatures of SN ejecta interacting with binary companion stars or circumstellar material. Some of these extragalactic transients are intrinsically rare and generally all hard to find, thus upcoming surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could dramatically improve our understanding of their origin and properties. We colloquially refer to such a strategy implementation for the LSST as the Presto-Color strategy (rapid-color). This cadenceâs minimal requirements allow for overall optimization of a survey for other science goals.}
